     Create
                To create a child object at a specific position,
                use one of the following:
                  Person.create(:parent_id => parent.id, :position => 2)
                  parent.children << Person.new(:position => 3)
                  parent.children.create(:position => 5)

                To create a new 'root', use:
                  Person.create(:position => 2)

                :position will default to the bottom of the parent's list
                :parent_id defaults to 0 (Class.roots)
