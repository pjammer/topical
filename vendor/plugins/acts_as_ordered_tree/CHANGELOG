v.1.2 - Wed May 17 2007
  - renamed syblings to siblings
  - renamed self_and_syblings to self_and_siblings
  - some other minor code changes
  - updated tests

  Note:
    I attempted to rewrite the tests using fixtures,
    but some of the tests were failing.
    I presume this is due to fixtures not supporting
    nested transactions. The results of this effort
    can be found in the fixtures_not_working/ branch.
